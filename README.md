## URL Launcher \(UPDATE\)


</div>

### Description

This is an UPDATE of my last URL Launcher. This code will launch a website by right clicking on the IExplorer icon from the Win98 quick launch taskbar. The choose Launch URL and the rest is easy. I have made it so you can clear the saved url's. Also if you enter a blank url and hit enter this will act as a cancle and close the program. The autocomplete of the url's now works and saves them to a txt file. You can also clear the saved url's by clicking clear url's from the list in the combobox.

You MUST compile this project into "c:\windows\browsefrom.exe" The RegKey.reg file got deleted by planet source code so I saved it into a .txt file. open the RegKey.txt file and save it As RegKey.reg and then merge it into your registry. If you do not merge the RegKey into the registry this program will NOT work. If anyone has any questions feel free to email me at u_tech@excite.com and PLEASE VOTE.
